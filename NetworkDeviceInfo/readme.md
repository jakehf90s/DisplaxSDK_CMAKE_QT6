# Network Device Info

Create a very simple Qml (GUI) application that shows all discovered services and their devices.

This example is similar to [Basic Print Device Info](../BasicPrintDeviceInfo/readme.md) but uses a graphical user interface (GUI),
and, by default, discovery all available DisplaxServices in network.
